    <caption>The straight-line path followed by a helicopter between the two points is shorter than the 14 blocks walked by the pedestrian. All blocks are square and the same size.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1165298981862">The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in <link target-id="import-auto-id1165298535408"/> is less than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general characteristic of vectors. (Recall that <term id="import-auto-id1165298541000">vectors</term> are quantities that have both magnitude and direction.)</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1165298648314">As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector’s magnitude. The arrow’s length is indicated by hash marks in <link target-id="import-auto-id1165296250183"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id1165298535408"/>. The arrow points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion, the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line path. For example, observe the three vectors in <link target-id="import-auto-id1165298535408"/>. The first represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector, with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example, the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in <link document="m42127">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods</link> and <link document="m42128">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods</link>.)</para></section>

    <title>Independence of Motion</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1165298709689">The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are independent of each other. Any motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.</para>
    </note>
    <para id="import-auto-id1165298786219">This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction first, followed by another. It is also true of more complicated motion involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let’s compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall.</para>

    <figure id="import-auto-id1165296248287"><media id="import-auto-id1165296709055" alt="Two identical balls one red and another blue are falling. Five positions of the balls during fall are shown. The horizontal velocity vectors for blue ball towards right are of same magnitude for all the positions. The vertical velocity vectors shown downwards for red ball are increasing with each position.">

    <caption>This shows the motions of two identical balls—one falls from rest, the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial horizontal velocity, while the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical velocities and positions are identical for both balls. This shows that the vertical and horizontal motions are independent.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1165298681613">It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the speed of the balls in both directions.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1165296226966">The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called <emphasis effect="italics">projectile motion</emphasis>, is to <emphasis effect="italics">resolve</emphasis> (break) it into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is possible because the components are independent. We shall see how to resolve vectors in <link document="m42127">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods</link> and <link document="m42128">Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods</link>. We will find such techniques to be useful in many areas of physics.</para></section>
