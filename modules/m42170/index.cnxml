Consider the two situations illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id1164400871370"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id1164400867302"/> where forces are applied to an ice hockey stick lying flat on ice. The net external force is zero in both situations shown in the figure; but in one case, equilibrium is achieved, whereas in the other, it is not. In <link target-id="import-auto-id1164400871370"/>, the ice hockey stick remains motionless. But in <link target-id="import-auto-id1164400867302"/>, with the same forces applied in different places, the stick experiences accelerated rotation. Therefore, we know that the point at which a force is applied is another factor in determining whether or not equilibrium is achieved. This will be explored further in the next section.</para>
