    <para id="import-auto-id2795511">It is one thing to have a system in equilibrium; it is quite another for it to be stable. The toy doll perched on the man’s hand in <link target-id="import-auto-id3549449"/>, for example, is not in stable equilibrium. There are <emphasis effect="italics">three types of equilibrium</emphasis>: <emphasis effect="italics">stable</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">unstable</emphasis>, and <emphasis effect="italics">neutral</emphasis>. Figures throughout this module illustrate various examples.</para><para id="import-auto-id2667255"><link target-id="import-auto-id3549449"/><emphasis effect="bold"/> presents <emphasis effect="bold"/>a balanced system, such as the toy doll on the man’s hand, which has its center of gravity (cg) directly over the pivot, so that the torque of the total weight is zero. This is equivalent to having the torques of the individual parts balanced about the pivot point, in this case the hand. The cgs of the arms, legs, head, and torso are labeled with smaller type.</para><figure id="import-auto-id3549449"><media id="import-auto-id2831185" alt="In the figure a man is shown balancing a child on his hand.

For example, a marble at the bottom of a bowl will experience a <emphasis effect="italics">restoring</emphasis> force when displaced from its equilibrium position.

A marble on a flat horizontal surface is an example. Combinations of these situations are possible.

  <caption>(a) Here we see neutral equilibrium. The cg of a sphere on a flat surface lies directly above the point of support, independent of the position on the surface. The sphere is therefore in equilibrium in any location, and if displaced, it will remain put. (b) Because it has a circular cross section, the pencil is in neutral equilibrium for displacements perpendicular to its length.</caption></figure>
<para id="import-auto-id2537182">When we consider how far a system in stable equilibrium can be displaced before it becomes unstable, we find that some systems in stable equilibrium are more stable than others. The pencil in <link target-id="import-auto-id1425416"/> and the person in <link target-id="import-auto-id3049283"/>(a) are in stable equilibrium, but become unstable for relatively small displacements to the side. The critical point is reached when the cg is no longer <emphasis effect="italics">above</emphasis> the base of support. Additionally, since the cg of a person’s body is above the pivots in the hips, displacements must be quickly controlled. This control is a central nervous system function that is developed when we learn to hold our bodies erect as infants. For increased stability while standing, the feet should be spread apart, giving a larger base of support. Stability is also increased by lowering one’s center of gravity by bending the knees, as when a football player prepares to receive a ball or braces themselves for a tackle. A cane, a crutch, or a walker increases the stability of the user, even more as the base of support widens. Usually, the cg of a female is lower (closer to the ground) than a male. Young children have their center of gravity between their shoulders, which increases the challenge of learning to walk. </para><figure id="import-auto-id3049283"><media id="import-auto-id2661191" alt="Part a of the figure shows a man standing on the ground.

<caption>(a) The  center of gravity of an adult is above the hip joints (one of the main pivots in the body) and lies between two narrowly-separated feet. Like a pencil standing on its eraser, this person is in stable equilibrium in relation to sideways displacements, but relatively small displacements take his cg outside the base of support and make him unstable. Humans are less stable relative to forward and backward displacements because the feet are not very long. Muscles are used extensively to balance the body in the front-to-back direction. (b) While bending in the manner shown, stability is increased by lowering the center of gravity. Stability is also increased if the base is expanded by placing the feet farther apart.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id3530352">Animals such as chickens have easier systems to control. <link target-id="import-auto-id3038931"/> shows that the cg of a chicken lies below its hip joints and between its widely separated and broad feet. Even relatively large displacements of the chicken’s cg are stable and result in restoring forces and torques that return the cg to its equilibrium position with little effort on the chicken’s part. Not all birds are like chickens, of course. Some birds, such as the flamingo, have balance systems that are almost as sophisticated as that of humans.</para><para id="import-auto-id1278540"><link target-id="import-auto-id3038931"/> shows that the cg of a chicken is below the hip joints and lies above a broad base of support formed by widely-separated and large feet. Hence, the chicken is in very stable equilibrium, since a relatively large displacement is needed to render it unstable. The body of the chicken is supported from above by the hips and acts as a pendulum between the hips. Therefore, the chicken is stable for front-to-back displacements as well as for side-to-side displacements.</para>

Although the examples in this section emphasize gravitational forces, the basic conditions for equilibrium are the same for all types of forces. The net external force must be zero, and the net torque must also be zero.</para>
