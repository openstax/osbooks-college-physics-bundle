The small current used by the hand-held calculator takes a much longer time to move a smaller charge than the large current of the truck starter. So why can we operate our calculators only seconds after turning them on? It's because calculators require very little energy. Such small current and energy demands allow handheld calculators to operate from solar cells or to get many hours of use out of small batteries. Remember, calculators do not have moving parts in the same way that a truck engine has with cylinders and pistons, so the technology requires smaller currents.</para></example>

<para id="import-auto-id1207319">Note that the direction of current in <link target-id="import-auto-id2931325"/> is from positive to negative. <emphasis effect="italics">The direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow</emphasis>. In a single loop circuit (as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id2931325"/>), the value for current at all points of the circuit should be the same if there are no losses. This is because current is the flow of charge and charge is conserved, i.e., the charge flowing out from the battery will be the same as the charge flowing into the battery. Depending on the situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, for example, current is carried by electrons—that is, negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positive and negative charges move. This is also true in nerve cells. A Van de Graaff generator used for nuclear research can produce a current of pure positive charges, such as protons. <link target-id="import-auto-id1575921"/> illustrates the movement of charged particles that compose a current. The fact that conventional current is taken to be in the direction that positive charge would flow can be traced back to American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin in the 1700s. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative, long before they were known to carry current in so many situations. Franklin, in fact, was totally unaware of the small-scale structure of electricity.</para><para id="import-auto-id2679164">It is important to realize that there is an electric field in conductors responsible for producing the current, as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id1575921"/>. Unlike static electricity, where a conductor in equilibrium cannot have an electric field in it, conductors carrying a current have an electric field and are not in static equilibrium. An electric field is needed to supply energy to move the charges.</para>

How do we reconcile these two speeds, and what does it tell us about standard conductors?</para><para id="import-auto-id1402961">The high speed of electrical signals results from the fact that the force between charges acts rapidly at a distance. Thus, when a free charge is forced into a wire, as in <link target-id="import-auto-id2670145"/>, the incoming charge pushes other charges ahead of it, which in turn push on charges farther down the line. The density of charge in a system cannot easily be increased, and so the signal is passed on rapidly. The resulting electrical shock wave moves through the system at nearly the speed of light. To be precise, this rapidly moving signal or shock wave is a rapidly propagating change in electric field.</para>

    <caption>When charged particles are forced into this volume of a conductor, an equal number are quickly forced to leave. The repulsion between like charges makes it difficult to increase the number of charges in a volume. Thus, as one charge enters, another leaves almost immediately, carrying the signal rapidly forward.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1578059">Good conductors have large numbers of free charges in them. In metals, the free charges are free electrons. <link target-id="import-auto-id1157496"/> shows how free electrons move through an ordinary conductor. The distance that an individual electron can move between collisions with atoms or other electrons is quite small. The electron paths thus appear nearly random, like the motion of atoms in a gas. But there is an electric field in the conductor that causes the electrons to drift in the direction shown (opposite to the field, since they are negative). The <term id="import-auto-id1215964">drift velocity </term><m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mtext>d</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> is the average velocity of the free charges.

    </note><para id="import-auto-id2691415">The free-electron collisions transfer energy to the atoms of the conductor. The electric field does work in moving the electrons through a distance, but that work does not increase the kinetic energy (nor speed, therefore) of the electrons. The work is transferred to the conductor's atoms, possibly increasing temperature. Thus a continuous power input is required to maintain current. An exception, of course, is found in superconductors, for reasons we shall explore in a later chapter. Superconductors can have a steady current without a continual supply of energy—a great energy savings. In contrast, the supply of energy can be useful, such as in a lightbulb filament. The supply of energy is necessary to increase the temperature of the tungsten filament, so that the filament glows.</para><note id="fs-id1531950"><label/><title>Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Filament Observations</title>

The speed of an electron is much greater than its drift velocity. In addition, not all of the electrons in a conductor can move freely, and those that do might move somewhat faster or slower than the drift velocity. So what do we mean by free electrons? Atoms in a metallic conductor are packed in the form of a lattice structure. Some electrons are far enough away from the atomic nuclei that they do not experience the attraction of the nuclei as much as the inner electrons do. These are the free electrons. They are not bound to a single atom but can instead move freely among the atoms in a “sea” of electrons. These free electrons respond by accelerating when an electric field is applied. Of course as they move they collide with the atoms in the lattice and other electrons, generating thermal energy, and the conductor gets warmer. In an insulator, the organization of the atoms and the structure do not allow for such free electrons.</para><example id="fs-id2616778"><title>Calculating Drift Velocity in a Common Wire</title><para id="import-auto-id1870821">Calculate the drift velocity of electrons in a 12-gauge copper wire (which has a diameter of 2.053 mm) carrying a 20.0-A current, given that there is one free electron per copper atom.
