    <para id="import-auto-id1563619">When light strikes materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called the <term id="import-auto-id1473737">photoelectric effect</term>, meaning that light (<emphasis effect="italics">photo</emphasis>) produces electricity. One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those that adjust the automatic iris on various types of cameras. In a similar way, another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have seen on a roof top or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices. </para>

 <caption>The photoelectric effect can be observed by allowing light to fall on the metal plate in this evacuated tube. Electrons ejected by the light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the collector wire and plate can then be adjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. For example, if it is sufficiently negative, no electrons will reach the wire. (credit: P.P. Urone)</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1488065">This effect has been known for more than a century and can be studied using a device such as that shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id1362766"/>. This figure shows an evacuated tube with a metal plate and a collector wire that are connected by a variable voltage source, with the collector more negative than the plate. When light (or other EM radiation) strikes the plate in the evacuated tube, it may eject electrons. If the electrons have energy in electron volts (eV) greater than the potential difference between the plate and the wire in volts, some electrons will be collected on the wire. Since the electron energy in eV is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mstyle fontstyle="italic"><m:mrow><m:mtext>qV</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mstyle></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math>, where <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>q</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> is the electron charge and <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>V</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> is the potential difference, the electron energy can be measured by adjusting the retarding voltage between the wire and the plate.

For example, if <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>–3.00 V</m:mn></m:mrow></m:math> barely stops the electrons, their energy is 3.00 eV.

In his explanation of the photoelectric effect, Einstein defined a quantized unit or quantum of EM energy, which we now call a <term id="import-auto-id1575989">photon</term>, with an energy proportional to the frequency of EM radiation.

This revolutionary idea looks similar to Planck’s quantization of energy states in blackbody oscillators, but it is quite different. It is the quantization of EM radiation itself. EM waves are composed of photons and are not continuous smooth waves as described in previous chapters on optics. Their energy is absorbed and emitted in lumps, not continuously.

All these properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon’s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mstyle fontstyle="italic"><m:mrow><m:mtext>hf</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mstyle></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math>.</para>

It is a far more general concept than its explanation of the photoelectric effect might imply. All EM radiation can also be modeled in the form of photons, and the characteristics of EM radiation are entirely consistent with this fact. (As we will see in the next section, many aspects of EM radiation, such as the hazards of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, can be explained <emphasis effect="italics">only</emphasis> by photon properties.) More famous for modern relativity, Einstein planted an important seed for quantum mechanics in 1905, the same year he published his first paper on special relativity. His explanation of the photoelectric effect was the basis for the Nobel Prize awarded to him in 1921. Although his other contributions to theoretical physics were also noted in that award, special and general relativity were not fully recognized in spite of having been partially verified by experiment by 1921. Although hero-worshipped, this great man never received Nobel recognition for his most famous work—relativity.</para>

But looking at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of eV, so that the UV photon in this example could have biological effects. The ejected electron (called a <emphasis effect="italics">photoelectron</emphasis>) has a rather low energy, and it would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of but 0.26 eV. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420-nm photons with their 2.96-eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can show for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 459 nm (blue light). This means that if calcium metal is used in a light meter, the meter will be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.</para></example><note id="eip-25" class="interactive"><label/><title>Photoelectric Effect</title>

<para id="fs-id2669198">During his experiments that confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves, Heinrich Hertz used a spark across a gap between two electrodes to provide the rapidly changing electric current that produced electromagnetic waves. He noticed, however, that production of the spark required a lower voltage in a well-lighted laboratory than when the room was dark. Describe how this curious event can be explained in terms of the quantum interpretation of the photoelectric effect.</para>
</problem>
<!--<solution id="fs-id2335970"><para id="fs-id1348075">High-energy (high-frequency) photons in the light caused electrons to be dislodged from the metal in the electrodes. This made it easier for a spark to cross the gap at a lower voltage. This is consistent with the quantum theory of light, but not the classical model. Electromagnetic waves were regarded as mechanical waves, and the energy of mechanical waves is associated with their intensity, which depends on amplitude. However, experimental evidence revealed that the energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency. This could be explained only by the quantum theory of light.</para>
