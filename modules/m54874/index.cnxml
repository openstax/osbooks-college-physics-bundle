    <para id="import-auto-id1169738072300">Present quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force follow a long tradition. In the 19th century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force has been shown to be connected to the electromagnetic force in a manner suggesting that a theory may be constructed in which all four forces are unified. Certainly, there are similarities in how forces are transmitted by the exchange of carrier particles, and the carrier particles themselves (the gauge bosons in <link document="m54868" target-id="import-auto-id1169736657305"/>) are also similar in important ways. The analogy to the unification of electric and magnetic forces is quite good—the four forces are distinct under normal circumstances, but there are hints of connections even on the atomic scale, and there may be conditions under which the forces are intimately related and even indistinguishable. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the <term id="import-auto-id1169738148021">Grand Unified Theory (GUT)</term>, is explored in this section in the realm of particle physics. <link document="m54824">Frontiers of Physics</link> expands the story in making a connection with cosmology, on the opposite end of the distance scale.</para><para id="import-auto-id1169737760884"><link target-id="import-auto-id1169736611236"/> is a Feynman diagram showing how the weak nuclear force is transmitted by the carrier particle <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mi>Z</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mn>0</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{Z rSup { size 8{0} } } {}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>, similar to the diagrams in <link document="m54864" target-id="import-auto-id1169738052383"/> and <link document="m54864" target-id="import-auto-id1169737991710"/> for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces. In the 1960s, a gauge theory, called <term id="import-auto-id1169737710958">electroweak theory</term>, was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies.

In 1983, these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having the predicted values as seen in <link document="m54868" target-id="import-auto-id1169736657305"/>. This was another triumph of particle theory and experimental effort, resulting in the 1984 Nobel Prize to the experiment's group leaders Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer.

Since electrons spend some time in the nucleus, their energies are affected, and spectra can even indicate new aspects of the weak force, such as the possibility of other carrier particles.

Like quarks, gluons may be confined to systems having a total color of white. Less is known about gluons than the fact that they are the carriers of the weak and certainly of the electromagnetic force. QCD theory calls for eight gluons, all massless and all spin 1. Six of the gluons carry a color and an anticolor, while two do not carry color, as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id1169737711152"/>(a). There is indirect evidence of the existence of gluons in nucleons. When high-energy electrons are scattered from nucleons and evidence of quarks is seen, the momenta of the quarks are smaller than they would be if there were no gluons. That means that the gluons carrying force between quarks also carry some momentum, inferred by the already indirect quark momentum measurements. At any rate, the gluons carry color charge and can change the colors of quarks when exchanged, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id1169737711152"/>(b).

Experiments have verified that the weak and electromagnetic force become identical at very small distances and provide the GUT description of the carrier particles for the forces. GUT predicts that the other forces become identical under conditions so extreme that they cannot be tested in the laboratory, although there may be lingering evidence of them in the evolution of the universe. GUT is also successful in describing a system of carrier particles for all four forces, but there is much to be done, particularly in the realm of gravity.

    <para id="import-auto-id1169738183173">In supernovas, neutrinos are produced in huge amounts. They were detected from the 1987A supernova in the Magellanic Cloud, which is about 120,000 light years away from the Earth (relatively close to our Milky Way galaxy). If neutrinos have a mass, they cannot travel at the speed of light, but if their mass is small, they can get close. (a) Suppose a neutrino with a <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>7</m:mn><m:mtext>-eV/</m:mtext><m:msup><m:mi>c</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{7"-eV/"c rSup { size 8{2} } } {}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> mass has a kinetic energy of 700 keV.

(b) If the neutrino leaves the 1987A supernova at the same time as a photon and both travel to Earth, how much sooner does the photon arrive? This is not a large time difference, given that it is impossible to know which neutrino left with which photon and the poor efficiency of the neutrino detectors. Thus, the fact that neutrinos were observed within hours of the brightening of the supernova only places an upper limit on the neutrino's mass. (Hint: You may need to use a series expansion to find <emphasis effect="italics">v</emphasis> for the neutrino, since its <m:math><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0"> size 12{γ} {}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> is so large.)</para>
