    <caption>In this graph of displacement versus time for a harmonic oscillator with a small amount of damping, the amplitude slowly decreases, but the period and frequency are nearly the same as if the system were completely undamped.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1998594">If you gradually <emphasis effect="italics">increase</emphasis> the amount of damping in a system, the period and frequency begin to be affected, because damping opposes and hence slows the back and forth motion.

If there is very large damping, the system does not even oscillate—it slowly moves toward equilibrium. <link target-id="import-auto-id1999732"/> shows the displacement of a harmonic oscillator for different amounts of damping. When we want to damp out oscillations, such as in the suspension of a car, we may want the system to return to equilibrium as quickly as possible <term id="import-auto-id3042494">Critical damping</term> is defined as the condition in which the damping of an oscillator results in it returning as quickly as possible to its equilibrium position The critically damped system may overshoot the equilibrium position, but if it does, it will do so only once.

In addition, a constant force applied to a critically damped system moves the system to a new equilibrium position in the shortest time possible without overshooting or oscillating about the new position. For example, when you stand on bathroom scales that have a needle gauge, the needle moves to its equilibrium position without oscillating. It would be quite inconvenient if the needle oscillated about the new equilibrium position for a long time before settling. Damping forces can vary greatly in character. Friction, for example, is sometimes independent of velocity (as assumed in most places in this text). But many damping forces depend on velocity—sometimes in complex ways, sometimes simply being proportional to velocity.</para>

<title>Making Connections: Damped Oscillator</title>
<para id="fs-id1356220">Consider a mass attached to a spring. This system oscillates when in air because air exerts almost no force on the spring. Now put this system in a liquid, say, water. You will see that the system hardly oscillates when in water. When the system is submerged in water an external force acts on the oscillator. This force is exerted by the liquid against the motion of the spring-mass oscillator and is responsible for the inhibition of oscillations. A force that inhibits oscillations is called a “damping force,” and the system that experiences it is called a “damped oscillator." A damped oscillator sees a change in its energy. With time the total energy of the oscillator, which would be its mechanical energy, decreases. Since energy has to be conserved, the energy gets converted into thermal energy, which is stored in the water and the spring.</para>

This is generally attained using non-conservative forces such as the friction between surfaces, and viscosity for objects moving through fluids. The following example considers friction.

Force F is applied to it from the right side, represented by a red arrow pointing toward the left and velocity v is equal to zero. An arrow showing the direction of force is also given alongside this figure as well as with the other four figures. The energy of the object is half k x squared.           In the given figure (b), after force is applied, the object moves to the left, compressing the spring slightly. The displacement of the object from its initial position is indicated by dots. The force F, here is equal to zero and velocity v, is maximum in the negative direction or the left. The energy of the object in this case is half m times negative v-max whole squared.           In the given figure (c), the spring has been compressed the maximum limit, and the amplitude is minus X. Now the force is toward the right, indicated here with a red arrow pointing to the right and the velocity, v, is zero. The energy of the object now is half k times negative x whole squared.           In the given figure (d), the spring is shown released from its compressed position and the object has moved toward the right side to reach the equilibrium level. Here, F is equal to zero, and the velocity, v, is the maximum. The energy of the object becomes half k times v max squared.           In the given figure (e), the spring has been stretched loose to the maximum possible limit and the object has moved to the far right. Now the velocity v, here is equal to zero and the direction of force is toward the left. As shown here, F is equal to zero. The energy of the object in this case is half k times x squared.">

The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknowns using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can see how to apply them across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of physics outside a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.</para>
