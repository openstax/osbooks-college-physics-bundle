    <para id="import-auto-id1616101">Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called <term id="import-auto-id1897071">ferromagnetic</term>, after the Latin word for iron, <emphasis effect="italics">ferrum</emphasis>. A group of materials made from the alloys of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent magnets; a popular one is neodymium. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets (the way iron is attracted to magnets), they can also be <term id="import-auto-id1838766">magnetized</term> themselves—that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets.</para><figure id="import-auto-id2093834"><media id="import-auto-id1732928" alt="An unmagnetized piece of iron is turned into a permanent magnet using heat and another magnet.">

    <caption>An unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets, heated, and then cooled, or simply tapped when cold. The iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that there are attractive forces between the magnets.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1515922">When a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the material with unlike poles closest, as in <link target-id="import-auto-id2093834"/>. (This results in the attraction of the previously unmagnetized material to the magnet.) What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id1455300"/>. The regions within the material called <term id="import-auto-id1726851">domains</term> act like small bar magnets. Within domains, the poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id1455300"/>(b). This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets.</para>

Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and the size of the domains. There is a well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the <term id="import-auto-id2259734">Curie temperature</term>, above which they cannot be magnetized.

    <title>Electromagnets</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1464843">Early in the 19th century, it was discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with magnets. <term id="import-auto-id2206858">Electromagnetism</term> is the use of electric current to make magnets. These temporarily induced magnets are called <term id="import-auto-id1476064">electromagnets</term>. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical imaging machines (See <link target-id="import-auto-id1455228"/>).</para><figure id="import-auto-id1455228"><media id="import-auto-id1583345" alt="M R I machine at a hospital.">

The patterns are similar. In fact, electromagnets and ferromagnets have the same basic characteristics—for example, they have north and south poles that cannot be separated and for which like poles repel and unlike poles attract.</para>
    <figure id="import-auto-id2187290"><media id="import-auto-id996373" alt="The arrangement of iron filings as they are affected by a metal coil that is carrying an electric current and a bar magnet. At the poles of the magnet, the filings are aligned radially to the poles. Between the poles, the filings are roughly parallel to the magnet. Thus, from one pole to the other, the filings have an arcuate arrangement. The density of filings is very high at the poles and relatively low on either side of the center of the magnet. The arrangement is similar around the current-carrying coil.">

    <caption>Iron filings near (a) a current-carrying coil and (b) a magnet act like tiny compass needles, showing the shape of their fields. Their response to a current-carrying coil and a permanent magnet is seen to be very similar, especially near the ends of the coil and the magnet.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1361787">Combining a ferromagnet with an electromagnet can produce particularly strong magnetic effects. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id2579978"/>.) Whenever strong magnetic effects are needed, such as lifting scrap metal, or in particle accelerators, electromagnets are enhanced by ferromagnetic materials. Limits to how strong the magnets can be made are imposed by coil resistance (it will overheat and melt at sufficiently high current), and so superconducting magnets may be employed. These are still limited, because superconducting properties are destroyed by too great a magnetic field.</para>

    <caption>An electromagnet with a ferromagnetic core can produce very strong magnetic effects. Alignment of domains in the core produces a magnet, the poles of which are aligned with the electromagnet.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id2208128"><link target-id="import-auto-id1208199"/> shows a few uses of combinations of electromagnets and ferromagnets. Ferromagnetic materials can act as memory devices, because the orientation of the magnetic fields of small domains can be reversed or erased. Magnetic information storage on videotapes and computer hard drives are among the most common applications. This property is vital in our digital world.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1208199"><media id="import-auto-id1535621" alt="Three views into a computer disk showing the magnetic portions of the recording head and the tape.">

    <caption>An electromagnet induces regions of permanent magnetism on a floppy disk coated with a ferromagnetic material. The information stored here is digital (a region is either magnetic or not); in other applications, it can be analog (with a varying strength), such as on audiotapes.</caption></figure></section>

    <title>Current: The Source of All Magnetism</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id2816553">An electromagnet creates magnetism with an electric current. In later sections we explore this more quantitatively, finding the strength and direction of magnetic fields created by various currents. But what about ferromagnets? <link target-id="import-auto-id2071727"/> shows models of how electric currents create magnetism at the submicroscopic level. (Note that we cannot directly observe the paths of individual electrons about atoms, and so a model or visual image, consistent with all direct observations, is made. We can directly observe the electron’s orbital angular momentum, its spin momentum, and subsequent magnetic moments, all of which are explained with electric-current-creating subatomic magnetism.) Currents, including those associated with other submicroscopic particles like protons, allow us to explain ferromagnetism and all other magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism, for example, results from an internal cooperative alignment of electron spins, possible in some materials but not in others.</para><para id="import-auto-id1564818">Crucial to the statement that electric current is the source of all magnetism is the fact that it is impossible to separate north and south magnetic poles. (This is far different from the case of positive and negative charges, which are easily separated.) A current loop always produces a magnetic dipole—that is, a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair. Since isolated north and south magnetic poles, called <term id="import-auto-id1524979">magnetic monopoles</term>, are not observed, currents are used to explain all magnetic effects. If magnetic monopoles did exist, then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current. There is no known reason that magnetic monopoles should not exist—they are simply never observed—and so searches at the subnuclear level continue. If they do <emphasis effect="italics">not</emphasis> exist, we would like to find out why not. If they <emphasis effect="italics">do</emphasis> exist, we would like to see evidence of them.</para><note id="fs-id2679100"><label/><title>Electric Currents and Magnetism</title>

      <caption>(a) In the planetary model of the atom, an electron orbits a nucleus, forming a closed-current loop and producing a magnetic field with a north pole and a south pole. (b) Electrons have spin and can be crudely pictured as rotating charge, forming a current that produces a magnetic field with a north pole and a south pole. Neither the planetary model nor the image of a spinning electron is completely consistent with modern physics. However, they do provide a useful way of understanding phenomena. </caption></figure>
