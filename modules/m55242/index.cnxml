        <para id="import-auto-id2436704">In <link document="m55016">Work, Energy, and Energy Resources</link>, we defined work as force times distance and learned that work done on an object changes its kinetic energy. We also saw in  <link document="m55232">Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws</link> that temperature is proportional to the (average) kinetic energy of atoms and molecules. We say that a thermal system has a certain internal energy: its internal energy is higher if the temperature is higher. If two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter to the colder object until equilibrium is reached and the bodies reach thermal equilibrium (i.e., they are at the same temperature). No work is done by either object, because no force acts through a distance. The transfer of energy is caused by the temperature difference, and ceases once the temperatures are equal. These observations lead to the following definition of <term id="import-auto-id3392999">heat</term>: Heat is the spontaneous transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. </para><para id="import-auto-id2444862">As noted in <link document="m55232">Temperature, Kinetic Theory, and the Gas Laws</link>, heat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. Heat is a form of energy, whereas temperature is not. The misconception arises because we are sensitive to the flow of heat, rather than the temperature.</para><para id="import-auto-id2674005">Owing to the fact that heat is a form of energy, it has the SI unit of <emphasis effect="italics">joule</emphasis> (J).

The equations for non-ideal gases, liquids, and solids are more complicated, but the general relation between the kinetic energies of the particles and the overall temperature of the substance still holds: the particles in the substance with the higher temperature have greater average kinetic energies than do the particles of a substance with a lower temperature.</para>
<para id="fs-id2066846">When the two substances are in thermal contact, the particles of both substances can collide with each other. In the vast majority of collisions, a particle with greater kinetic energy will transfer some of its energy to a particle with lower kinetic energy. By giving up this energy, the average kinetic energy of this particle is reduced, and therefore, the temperature of the substance associated with that particle decreases slightly. Similarly, the average kinetic energy of the particle in the second substance increases through the collision, causing that substance’s temperature to increase by a minuscule amount. In this way, through a vast number of particle collisions, thermal energy is transferred macroscopically from the substance with greater temperature (that is, greater internal energy) to the substance with lower temperature (lower internal energy).</para>
<para id="fs-id2550033">Macroscopically, heat appears to transfer thermal energy spontaneously in only one direction. When interpreted at the microscopic level, the transfer of kinetic energy between particles occurs in both directions. This is because some of the particles in the low-temperature substance have higher kinetic energies than the particles in the high-temperature substance, so that some of the energy transfer is in the direction from the lower temperature substance to the higher temperature substance. However, much more of the energy is transferred in the other direction. When thermal equilibrium is reached, the energy transfer in either direction is, on average, the same, so that there is no further change in the internal energy, or temperature, of either substance.</para>

It demonstrated that work and heat can produce the same effects, and helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (PE) (work done by the gravitational force) is converted into kinetic energy (KE), and then randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the system, producing a temperature increase. His contributions to the field of thermodynamics were so significant that the SI unit of energy was named after him.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id3104671">Heat added or removed from a system changes its internal energy and thus its temperature. Such a temperature increase is observed while cooking. However, adding heat does not necessarily increase the temperature. An example is melting of ice; that is, when a substance changes from one phase to another. Work done on the system or by the system can also change the internal energy of the system. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of a system can be increased by stirring. If an ice cube is rubbed against a rough surface, work is done by the frictional force. A system has a well-defined internal energy, but we cannot say that it has a certain “heat content” or “work content”. We use the phrase “heat transfer” to emphasize its nature.</para>
