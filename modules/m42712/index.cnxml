    <para id="import-auto-id2583065">The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the <term id="import-auto-id1468039">Doppler effect</term>. The high-pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary observer. The closer the motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. It is so familiar that it is used to imply motion and children often mimic it in play.</para><para id="import-auto-id1955117">The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the observer. Although less familiar, this effect is easily noticed for a stationary source and moving observer. For example, if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. The actual change in frequency due to relative motion of source and observer is called a <term id="import-auto-id3069643">Doppler shift</term>. The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler (1803–1853), who did experiments with both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example, had musicians play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks as a train passed by. Their music was observed both on and off the train, and changes in frequency were measured.</para><para id="import-auto-id3143118">What causes the Doppler shift? <link target-id="import-auto-id2980092"/>, <link target-id="import-auto-id1999554"/>, and <link target-id="import-auto-id2449194"/> compare sound waves emitted by stationary and moving sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from the point where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of the spheres representing the air compressions in the sound wave centered on the same point, and the stationary observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source, as in <link target-id="import-auto-id2980092"/>. If the source is moving, as in <link target-id="import-auto-id1999554"/>, then the situation is different. Each compression of the air moves out in a sphere from the point where it was emitted, but the point of emission moves. This moving emission point causes the air compressions to be closer together on one side and farther apart on the other. Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in <link target-id="import-auto-id1999554"/>), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in <link target-id="import-auto-id1999554"/>). Finally, if the observers move, as in <link target-id="import-auto-id2449194"/>, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency, and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency.</para><figure id="import-auto-id2980092"><media id="import-auto-id2591175" alt="Sound waves coming out of a car stopped on a road are shown as spherical areas of compression.

    <caption>Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.</caption></figure><figure id="import-auto-id2449194"><media id="import-auto-id3085341" alt="A car is shown stopped on a road.

    <caption>The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id2678168">We know that wavelength and frequency are related by <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mn>w</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo stretchy="false">=</m:mo><m:mi fontstyle="italic">fλ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>, where <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mn>w</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> is the fixed speed of sound.

Because the observer on the right in <link target-id="import-auto-id1999554"/>  receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength, and hence he hears a lower frequency. The same thing happens in <link target-id="import-auto-id2449194"/>. A higher frequency is received by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is received by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency. Relative motion apart decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.</para><note id="fs-id1825028"><label/>
    <title>The Doppler Effect</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id1969885">The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source. There are Doppler shifts in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for example. Doppler shifts can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a medical diagnostic. The recession of galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from them and has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by observations of Doppler shifts.</para></note>

(Before airplanes exceeded the speed of sound, some people argued it would be impossible because such constructive superposition would produce pressures great enough to destroy the airplane.) If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the approaching source are mixed with those from it when receding.

This superposition forms a disturbance called a <term id="import-auto-id1448364">sonic boom</term>, a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the cone, the interference is mostly destructive, and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave. An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id3027669"/>.) During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id3027669"/>. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as rattle nerves. Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.</para>

They can be of considerable use. For example, the Doppler shift in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, while police use the Doppler shift in radar (a microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology, the Doppler shift is used to track the motion of storm clouds; such “Doppler Radar” can give velocity and direction and rain or snow potential of imposing weather fronts. In astronomy, we can examine the light emitted from distant galaxies and determine their speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away from us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer wavelength—the so-called red shift. Such information from galaxies far, far away has allowed us to estimate the age of the universe (from the Big Bang) as about 14 billion years. </para>
