    <para id="import-auto-id2970817"><link target-id="import-auto-id3230544"/> shows the effect of an electric field on free charges in a conductor. The free charges move until the field is perpendicular to the conductor’s surface. There can be no component of the field parallel to the surface in electrostatic equilibrium, since, if there were, it would produce further movement of charge. A positive free charge is shown, but free charges can be either positive or negative and are, in fact, negative in metals. The motion of a positive charge is equivalent to the motion of a negative charge in the opposite direction.</para>

Consider a system of two metal plates with opposite charges on them, as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id2594161"/>. The properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium indicate that the electric field between the plates will be uniform in strength and direction. Except near the edges, the excess charges distribute themselves uniformly, producing field lines that are uniformly spaced (hence uniform in strength) and perpendicular to the surfaces (hence uniform in direction, since the plates are flat). The edge effects are less important when the plates are close together.</para>

    <title>Electric Fields on Uneven Surfaces</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id3175345">So far we have considered excess charges on a smooth, symmetrical conductor surface. What happens if a conductor has sharp corners or is pointed? Excess charges on a nonuniform conductor become concentrated at the sharpest points. Additionally, excess charge may move on or off the conductor at the sharpest points.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id1132467">To see how and why this happens, consider the charged conductor in <link target-id="import-auto-id2398984"/>. The electrostatic repulsion of like charges is most effective in moving them apart on the flattest surface, and so they become least concentrated there. This is because the forces between identical pairs of charges at either end of the conductor are identical, but the components of the forces parallel to the surfaces are different. The component parallel to the surface is greatest on the flattest surface and, hence, more effective in moving the charge.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id2400840">The same effect is produced on a conductor by an externally applied electric field, as seen in <link target-id="import-auto-id2398984"/> (c). Since the field lines must be perpendicular to the surface, more of them are concentrated on the most curved parts.</para>

    <para id="import-auto-id3450035">On a very sharply curved surface, such as shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id2677542"/>, the charges are so concentrated at the point that the resulting electric field can be great enough to remove them from the surface. This can be useful.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id2399976">Lightning rods work best when they are most pointed. The large charges created in storm clouds induce an opposite charge on a building that can result in a lightning bolt hitting the building. The induced charge is bled away continually by a lightning rod, preventing the more dramatic lightning strike.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id2578321">Of course, we sometimes wish to prevent the transfer of charge rather than to facilitate it. In that case, the conductor should be very smooth and have as large a radius of curvature as possible. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id1993313"/>.) Smooth surfaces are used on high-voltage transmission lines, for example, to avoid leakage of charge into the air.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id3119606">Another device that makes use of some of these principles is a <term id="import-auto-id1934114">Faraday cage</term>. This is a metal shield that encloses a volume. All electrical charges will reside on the outside surface of this shield, and there will be no electrical field inside. A Faraday cage is used to prohibit stray electrical fields in the environment from interfering with sensitive measurements, such as the electrical signals inside a nerve cell.</para><para id="import-auto-id3079151">During electrical storms if you are driving a car, it is best to stay inside the car as its metal body acts as a Faraday cage with zero electrical field inside. If in the vicinity of a lightning strike, its effect is felt on the outside of the car and the inside is unaffected, provided you remain totally inside. This is also true if an active (“hot”) electrical wire was broken (in a storm or an accident) and fell on your car.</para>
