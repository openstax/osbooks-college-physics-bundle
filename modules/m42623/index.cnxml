    <para id="import-auto-id2382456">The discovery and study of nuclear radioactivity quickly revealed evidence of revolutionary new physics. In addition, uses for nuclear radiation also emerged quickly—for example, people such as Ernest Rutherford used it to determine the size of the nucleus and devices were painted with radium-doped paint to make them glow in the dark (see <link target-id="import-auto-id3209830"/>). We therefore begin our study of nuclear physics with the discovery and basic features of nuclear radioactivity.</para><figure id="import-auto-id3209830"><media id="import-auto-id3076369" alt="The image shows an aircraft panel with lots of dial indicators, some levers and two wheels.">

    <caption>The dials of this World War II aircraft glow in the dark, because they are painted with radium-doped phosphorescent paint. It is a poignant reminder of the dual nature of radiation. Although radium paint dials are conveniently visible day and night, they emit radon, a radioactive gas that is hazardous and is not directly sensed.

The rays therefore carry energy; but amazingly, the pitchblende emits them continuously without any energy input. This is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that we now understand is due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as related in Einstein’s famous equation <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="italic">E</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msup><m:mi mathvariant="italic">mc</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>. It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. The emission of these rays is called <emphasis>nuclear radioactivity</emphasis> or simply <term id="term-00001">radioactivity</term>. The rays themselves are called <term id="term-00002">nuclear radiation</term>. A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to <term id="term-00003">decay</term> (a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states). A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be <term id="term-00004">radioactive</term>.</para><para id="import-auto-id1514494">Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel’s rays originate deep in the heart (or nucleus) of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Radiation does not vary with chemical state—that is, uranium is radioactive whether it is in the form of an element or compound. In addition, radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of these factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies of the order of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mtext>10</m:mtext><m:mrow><m:mn>6</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mspace width="0.25em"/><m:mtext>eV</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> per event, which is much greater than the typical atomic energies (a few <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>eV</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math>), such as that observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic characteristic x rays. Becquerel did not vigorously pursue his discovery for very long. In 1898, Marie Curie (1867–1934), then a graduate student married to the already well-known French physicist Pierre Curie (1859–1906), began her doctoral study of Becquerel’s rays. She and her husband soon discovered two new radioactive elements, which she named <emphasis effect="italics">polonium</emphasis> (after her native land) and <emphasis effect="italics">radium</emphasis> (because it radiates). These two new elements filled holes in the periodic table and, further, displayed much higher levels of radioactivity per gram of material than uranium. Over a period of four years, working under poor conditions and spending their own funds, the Curies processed more than a ton of uranium ore to isolate a gram of radium salt. Radium became highly sought after, because it was about two million times as radioactive as uranium. Curie’s radium salt glowed visibly from the radiation that took its toll on them and other unaware researchers. Shortly after completing her Ph.D., both Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on radioactivity. Pierre was killed in a horse cart accident in 1906, but Marie continued her study of radioactivity for nearly 30 more years. Awarded the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of two new elements, she remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Marie’s radioactive fingerprints on some pages of her notebooks can still expose film, and she suffered from radiation-induced lesions. She died of leukemia likely caused by radiation, but she was active in research almost until her death in 1934. The following year, her daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie, were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificially induced radiation, adding to a remarkable family legacy.</para></section>

All three types of nuclear radiation produce <emphasis effect="italics">ionization</emphasis> in materials, but they penetrate different distances in materials—that is, they have different <emphasis effect="italics">ranges</emphasis>. Let us examine why they have these characteristics and what are some of the consequences.</para><para id="import-auto-id1901135">Like x rays, nuclear radiation in the form of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s, <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s, and <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s has enough energy per event to ionize atoms and molecules in any material.

The effects of x rays and nuclear radiation on biological tissues and other materials, such as solid state electronics, are directly related to the ionization they produce. All of them, for example, can damage electronics or kill cancer cells. In addition, methods for detecting x rays and nuclear radiation are based on ionization, directly or indirectly. All of them can ionize the air between the plates of a capacitor, for example, causing it to discharge. This is the basis of inexpensive personal radiation monitors, such as pictured in <link target-id="import-auto-id1900612"/>.

We define <term id="import-auto-id2968914">ionizing radiation</term><emphasis effect="bold"/> as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not, since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1900612"><media id="import-auto-id1871385" alt="Image shows a person’s hand holding a cylindrical object placed near a small piece of radioactive material.

    <caption>These dosimeters (literally, dose meters) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor.

Range is related to several factors, including the energy of the radiation, the material encountered, and the type of radiation (see <link target-id="import-auto-id3385282"/>). The higher the <emphasis effect="italics">energy</emphasis>, the greater the range, all other factors being the same. This makes good sense, since radiation loses its energy in materials primarily by producing ionization in them, and each ionization of an atom or a molecule requires energy that is removed from the radiation. The amount of ionization is, thus, directly proportional to the energy of the particle of radiation, as is its range.</para>

The range of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s is thus greater than the range of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s.</para><para id="import-auto-id3253816">Alpha radiation from radioactive sources has a range much less than a millimeter of biological tissues, usually not enough to even penetrate the dead layers of our skin. On the other hand, the same <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> radiation can penetrate a few centimeters of air, so mere distance from a source prevents <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> radiation from reaching us. This makes <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> radiation relatively safe for our body compared to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> and <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> radiation. Typical <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> radiation can penetrate a few millimeters of tissue or about a meter of air. Beta radiation is thus hazardous even when not ingested. The range of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s in lead is about a millimeter, and so it is easy to store  <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> sources in lead radiation-proof containers. Gamma rays have a much greater range than either <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s or <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s. In fact, if a given thickness of material, like a lead brick, absorbs 90% of the <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s, then a second lead brick will only absorb 90% of what got through the first. Thus, <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s do not have a well-defined range; we can only cut down the amount that gets through. Typically, <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s can penetrate many meters of air, go right through our bodies, and are effectively shielded (that is, reduced in intensity to acceptable levels) by many centimeters of lead. One benefit of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>s is that they can be used as radioactive tracers (see <link target-id="import-auto-id2589483"/>).</para><figure id="import-auto-id2589483"><media id="import-auto-id2402987" alt="This figure shows four images of a skeleton of a human.

    <caption>This image of the concentration of a radioactive tracer in a patient’s body reveals where the most active bone cells are, an indication of bone cancer. A short-lived radioactive substance that locates itself selectively is given to the patient, and the radiation is measured with an external detector. The emitted <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>γ</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> radiation has a sufficient range to leave the body—the range of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s and <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>β</m:mi></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> s is too small for them to be observed outside the patient.
