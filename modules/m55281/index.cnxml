    <caption>Waves in the ocean behave similarly to all other types of waves. (credit: Steve Jurveston, Flickr) </caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id2669688">What do we mean when we say something is a wave? The most intuitive and easiest wave to imagine is the familiar water wave. More precisely, a <term id="import-auto-id2962757">wave</term> is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, perhaps created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps created by the oscillating cone inside a speaker. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, including disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy with water waves. Visualizing water waves is useful because there is more to it than just a mental image. Water waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying principles.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-id3149964">A wave is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. The simplest waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic motion. Let us start by considering the simplified water wave in <link target-id="import-auto-id3201529"/>. The wave is an up and down disturbance of the water surface. It causes a sea gull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under the bird.

    <para id="import-auto-id490321">Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In fact, the particles of water tend to stay in one location, save for moving up and down due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves forward through the water, but the water stays in one place. If you feel yourself pushed in an ocean, what you feel is the energy of the wave, not a rush of water.</para>

<title>Applying the Science Practices: Different Types of Waves</title>
<para id="fs-id1255415">Consider a spring fixed to a wall with a mass connected to its end. This fixed point on the wall exerts a force on the complete spring-and-mass system, and this implies that the momentum of the complete system is not conserved. Now, consider energy. Since the system is fixed to a point on the wall, it does not do any work; hence, the total work done is conserved,which means that the energy is conserved. Consequently, we have an oscillator in which energy is conserved but momentum is not. Now, consider a system of two masses connected to each other by a spring. This type of system also forms an oscillator. Since there is no fixed point, momentum is conserved as the forces acting on the two masses are equal and opposite. Energy for such a system will be conserved, because there are no external forces acting on the spring-two-masses system. It is clear from above that, for momentum to be conserved, momentum needs to be carried by waves. Thisis a typical example of a mechanical oscillator producing mechanical waves, which need a medium in which to propagate. Sound waves are also examples of mechanical waves. Some types of waves can travel in the absence of a medium of propagation. Such waves ; they are called “electromagnetic waves.” Light waves are examples of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are created by the vibration of electric charge . which This vibration creates a wave with both electric and magnetic field components.</para>
