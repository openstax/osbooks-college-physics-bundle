<title>Applying Science Practices: Angular Momentum and Torque</title>
<para id="fs-id1541787">You have seen that change in angular momentum depends on the average torque applied and the time interval during which the torque is applied. Plan an experiment similar to the one shown in <link target-id="import-auto-id3014014">Figure 10.30</link> to test the relationship between the change in angular momentum of a system and the product of the average torque applied to the system and the time interval during which the torque is exerted. What would you use as your test system? How could you measure applied torque? What observations could you make to help you analyze changes in angular momentum? Remember that, since angular momentum is a vector, changes can relate to its magnitude or its direction.</para>

The gyroscope <emphasis effect="italics">precesses</emphasis> around a vertical axis, since the torque is always horizontal and perpendicular to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext mathvariant="bold">L</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>.
