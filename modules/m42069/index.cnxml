        <para id="import-auto-id2380148"><term id="import-auto-id2134480">Dynamics</term> is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we need a working definition of force. Our intuitive definition of <term id="import-auto-id2712510">force</term>—that is, a push or a pull—is a good place to start. We know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can vary considerably in each regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id2379809"/>, we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id2379809"/>(a) for two ice skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or by trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in <link document="m42126">Two-Dimensional Kinematics</link>.</para><figure id="import-auto-id2379809"><media id="import-auto-id2659946" alt="(a) Overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. One skater pushes with a force F two, represented by an arrow pointing up, and a second skater pushes with a force F one, represented by an arrow pointing from left to right. Vector F one and vector F two are along the arms of the two skaters acting on the third skater. A vector diagram is shown in the form of a right triangle in which the base is vector F one pointing east and perpendicular is shown by vector F two pointing north. The resultant vector is shown by the hypotenuse pointing northeast. (b) Free-body diagram showing only the forces acting on the skater.">

        <caption>Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1374790"><link target-id="import-auto-id2379809"/>(b) is our first example of a <term id="import-auto-id1590568">free-body diagram</term>, which is a technique used to illustrate all the <term id="import-auto-id1608860">external forces</term> acting on a body. The body is represented by a single isolated point (or free body), and only those forces acting <emphasis effect="italics">on</emphasis> the body from the outside (external forces) are shown. (These forces are the only ones shown, because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body.) Free-body diagrams are very useful in analyzing forces acting on a system and are employed extensively in the study and application of Newton’s laws of motion.</para><para id="import-auto-id1905924">A more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance, as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id2608835"/>, and use the force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape—called a <emphasis effect="italics">restoring force</emphasis>—as a standard. The magnitude of all other forces can be stated as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other possibilities exist for standard forces. (One that we will encounter in <link document="m42365">Magnetism</link> is the magnetic force between two wires carrying electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.</para><figure id="import-auto-id2608835"><media id="import-auto-id2630816" alt="(a) A spring of length x, fixed at one end, is shown in horizontal position.

            <para id="import-auto-id2686295">To investigate force standards and cause and effect, get two identical rubber bands. Hang one rubber band vertically on a hook. Find a small household item that could be attached to the rubber band using a paper clip, and use this item as a weight to investigate the stretch of the rubber band. Measure the amount of stretch produced in the rubber band with one, two, and four of these (identical) items suspended from the rubber band. What is the relationship between the number of items and the amount of stretch? How large a stretch would you expect for the same number of items suspended from two rubber bands? What happens to the amount of stretch of the rubber band (with the weights attached) if the weights are also pushed to the side with a pencil? </para>
