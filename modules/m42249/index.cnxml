  <caption>These waves result from the superposition of several waves from different sources, producing a complex pattern.

They look more like the waves in <link target-id="import-auto-id1386289"/> than like the simple water wave considered in <link document="m42248">Waves</link>. (Simple waves may be created by a simple harmonic oscillation, and thus have a sinusoidal shape). Complex waves are more interesting, even beautiful, but they look formidable. Most waves appear complex because they result from several simple waves adding together. Luckily, the rules for adding waves are quite simple.</para><para id="import-auto-id3047262">When two or more waves arrive at the same point, they superimpose themselves on one another. More specifically, the disturbances of waves are superimposed when they come together—a phenomenon called <term id="import-auto-id3047530">superposition</term>. Each disturbance corresponds to a force, and forces add. If the disturbances are along the same line, then the resulting wave is a simple addition of the disturbances of the individual waves—that is, their amplitudes add. <link target-id="import-auto-id3008153"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id2429185"/> illustrate superposition in two special cases, both of which produce simple results.</para>

    <caption>Pure destructive interference of two identical waves produces zero amplitude, or complete cancellation.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1177237">While pure constructive and pure destructive interference do occur, they require precisely aligned identical waves. The superposition of most waves produces a combination of constructive and destructive interference and can vary from place to place and time to time. Sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and quiet in another. Varying loudness means the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose. An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of airplane jets heard by a stationary passenger. The combined sound can fluctuate up and down in volume as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive. These examples are of waves that are similar.</para>

      <title>Standing Waves</title>
    <para id="import-auto-id2655621">Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place. Unmoving waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator, for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. These waves are formed by the superposition of two or more moving waves, such as illustrated in <link target-id="import-auto-id3053471"/> for two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a <term id="import-auto-id1488365">standing wave</term>. Waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves. There are other standing waves, such as on guitar strings and in organ pipes. With the glass of milk, the two waves that produce standing waves may come from reflections from the side of the glass.</para><para id="import-auto-id1954035">A closer look at earthquakes provides evidence for conditions appropriate for resonance, standing waves, and constructive and destructive interference. A building may be vibrated for several seconds with a driving frequency matching that of the natural frequency of vibration of the building—producing a resonance resulting in one building collapsing while neighboring buildings do not. Often buildings of a certain height are devastated while other taller buildings remain intact. The building height matches the condition for setting up a standing wave for that particular height. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain points. Often areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther away are damaged.</para><figure id="import-auto-id3053471"><media id="import-auto-id3294294" alt="Standing wave combinations of two waves is shown.

In the second figure at time t is equal to one fourth of time period T , the waves are in opposite phase so their super imposed figure is a straight line. Again at the time t is equal to half the time period the waves are in the same phase and the process is repeated at t is equal to three fourth of time period and at the end of the time period T.">

   <caption>Standing wave created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at fixed locations in space and result from alternately constructive and destructive interference.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1917426">Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. <link target-id="import-auto-id3165180"/> and <link target-id="import-auto-id3045433"/> show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. <term id="import-auto-id1974297">Nodes</term> are the points where the string does not move; more generally, nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave.

    <para id="import-auto-id2054965">Striking two adjacent keys on a piano produces a warbling combination usually considered to be unpleasant. The superposition of two waves of similar but not identical frequencies is the culprit. Another example is often noticeable in jet aircraft, particularly the two-engine variety, while taxiing. The combined sound of the engines goes up and down in loudness. This varying loudness happens because the sound waves have similar but not identical frequencies. The discordant warbling of the piano and the fluctuating loudness of the jet engine noise are both due to alternately constructive and destructive interference as the two waves go in and out of phase. <link target-id="import-auto-id3355582"/> illustrates this graphically.</para><figure id="import-auto-id3355582"><media id="import-auto-id2595116" alt="The graph shows the superimposition of two similar but non-identical waves.

    <para id="import-auto-id1328917">Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats and adjust the string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). For example, if the tuning fork has a <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>256</m:mtext><m:mi/><m:mspace width="0.25em"/><m:mtext>Hz</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> frequency and two beats per second are heard, then the other frequency is either <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>254</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> or <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mtext>258</m:mtext><m:mspace width="0.25em"/><m:mtext>Hz</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math>. Most keys hit multiple strings, and these strings are actually adjusted until they have nearly the same frequency and give a slow beat for richness. Twelve-string guitars and mandolins are also tuned using beats.</para></note>
    <para id="import-auto-id3077114">While beats may sometimes be annoying in audible sounds, we will find that beats have many applications. Observing beats is a very useful way to compare similar frequencies. There are applications of beats as apparently disparate as in ultrasonic imaging and radar speed traps.</para>
